Create an LCD clock with HH:MM display. The user should be able to set color of the digits, change the background image, set the time-zone, and the time format â€“ 24hr/12hr. In 12-hour format, show AM/PM. Make sure the clock rotates correctly when the device is rotated and is displayed properly on different devices.
